    "blogp1":"Wireless Networking (Wi-Fi) has made it so easy for anyone to use Internet on your computer, mobile phones, tablets and other wireless devices anywhere in the house without the clutter of cables. With traditional wired networks, it is extremely difficult for someone to steal your bandwidth but the big problem with wireless signals is that others can access the Internet using your broadband connection even while they are in a neighboring building or sitting in a car that’s parked outside your apartment.",
    "blogp2":"There have been quite a few instances where innocent Internet users have been arrested for sending hate emails when in reality, their email accounts where hacked though the unsecured Wi-Fi networks that they had at home. Wireshark is a free packet sniffing tool for Linux, Mac and Windows that can scan traffic flowing though a wireless network including cookies, forms and other HTTP requests.The good news is that it is not very hard to make your wireless network secure, which will both prevent others from stealing your internet and will also prevent hackers from taking control of your computers through your own wireless network."

    "blogp1":"“NeuroPositivity is what results when you increase the growth and stimulation of neuropathways in the brain that control positivity. We can liken it to a positive state of mind, but it really goes even further. It is a positive state of being.” - Dr. William Larkin",
    "blogp2":"The Applied Neuroscience Blog is written by Dr. William Larkin of the The Applied Neuroscience Institute. Dr. Larkin illustrates the importance of what’s good and virtuous in psychology, hence the name of the NeuroPositive Method. Studies reveal that focusing on strengths and talents is more effective than getting hung up on weaknesses and negative symptoms. The Applied Neuroscience Blog answers many questions about positive psychology with unique and constructive information."

    "img":"img1",
    "date":"03-NOV-2018",
    "auth":"Susukuva",
    "blogp1":"Two hundred and seventy white garbage bags hang like ghosts in the columned hall of Vienna, Austria’s Museum für agewandte Kunst (MAK) for the exhibition Sagmeister & Walsh: Beauty. The piece is by Nils Völker (previously), and is titled after the number of bags present in the installation. Over 1000 precisely installed fans and 45 circuit boards keep their movement on track, helping to rhythmically inflate and deflate the hanging plastic objects. The repetitive crinkling fills the vast hall, creating an audio texture akin to the rustling of tissue paper or the sound of the tide on a sandy beach.",
    "blogp2":"The concave installation is divided into nine segments that each contain two columns of plastic bags. While viewing the piece from the front you can only make out the white mass of plastic. Viewing it from the side or rear however, reveals the massive amount of cables and circuitry needed to make what appears to be such an effortless piece of art function. Two Hundred and Seventy is on view at MAK in Vienna through March 2019."

    "blogp1":"‘A mahout is an elephant rider, trainer, or keeper. Usually, a mahout starts as a boy in the family profession when he is assigned an elephant early in its life. They remain bonded to each other throughout their lives’.That’s Wikipedia’s definition of a mahout, and one which will chime with many tourists who have a romantic vision of mahouts and their relationship with elephants. But sadly, the reality in the elephant tourism industry is very different.Our new research, carried out with the Department of Sociology and Anthropology at Chiang Mai University in Thailand, shows the idealistic, commonly held perception of mahouts is quite far from the truth. The study is the first comprehensive research on the socioeconomic situation of mahouts across Thailand.",
    "blogp2":"With a growing tourism industry and demand for elephant entertainment, often at venues with lots of visitors, the traditional role of mahouts is being increasingly taken over by regular labourers, who lack sufficient skills and training.That’s not to say mahouts in the traditional sense don’t exist – they do, and I witnessed them myself on a recent trip to Thailand. But they’re the exception, not the rule.The reality is many mahouts take it up because they cannot find alternative employment or believe it will be an easy job."

    "blogp1":"As the U.S. emerges from a polarizing and divisive midterm election, Ocean Conservancy looks forward to continuing our work on important issues, on behalf of our members and the millions of people who depend on a healthy ocean.In the 115th Congress, our ocean saw many important and hard-fought battles over environmental policy, as well as an occasional bright spot of ocean-friendly legislative accomplishment, such as passage of the SOS Act and the continuation of steady funding for NOAA. As this congress enters the final weeks of its lame-duck session, we must remain vigilant to protect current conservation laws until the congress adjourns. We must also push this congress to immediately address the harmful algal blooms that have plagued our coasts.",
    "blogp2":"It’s easy to get caught up in the divisiveness of today’s political climate, but we have more in common than we realize. Each and every one of us relies on our ocean—and protecting it is a mission that unites all of us from coast to coast, Alaska to Hawaii."

As usual, not knowing anything about a subject doesn't stop some clients from thinking they know what's best, telling you you're bad at your job, or simply refusing to pay after you've produced the work.",
    "blogp2":"This blog is a must for anyone who has ever freelanced in a creative capacity, specifically graphic design, photography, or writing.  The examples you'll read on CFH might sometimes make your blood boil, but you'll also find yourself laughing over the ridiculous questions posed by people who still haven't quite mastered how to reboot their computers, but still feel qualified to complain or criticize the pros."

The entire interaction sparked a much larger […]"
